stage 8 - 9:
  topic: Basic 3D objects/meshes
  tasks:
    - create 3D camera (static) and add to the scene
    - add a directional light to the scene
    - add environment to the scene
    - run the game window
  changes:
    MainScene:
      - Camera3D:
        name: MainCamera
        transform: # adjust to see the whole scene
          position: (0, 20, 25)

                radius: 2
                radial segment: 100
                rings: 100

  changes:
    MainScene:
      - Tree: # save as scene
          name: TreeScene
      - Ball: # save as scene
          name: BallScene
      - Tree1: # duplicate TreeScene
          transform:
            position: any
      - Tree2: # duplicate TreeScene
